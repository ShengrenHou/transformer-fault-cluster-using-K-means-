'''this script is used to help enze to use Kmeans for her own DGA data'''
##1.  data prepocessing (1: import data 2: data preprocessing(do we need normoalization?, do we need to split data as test and train data))
##2. train the kmeans model, get y_pred
##3. evaluate the performance of the kmeans on our data
    # evaluate analysis for each data
    # evaluate using accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and ROC figure
